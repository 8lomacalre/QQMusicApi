The film was originally intended as a pitch for a reboot of the Mortal Kombat film series, but it was leaked online and became viral, receiving positive feedback from fans and critics. The film's success led to the creation of Mortal Kombat: Legacy, a web series that expanded on the film's concept and characters. The film also influenced the development of Mortal Kombat (2011), the ninth installment of the video game series, which incorporated some of the film's elements and aesthetics.

Mortal Kombat: Rebirth is not only a fan-made tribute to the Mortal Kombat franchise, but also a showcase of the talent and passion of its director and actors. Kevin Tancharoen, who previously directed the remake of Fame (2009), used his own money and resources to create the film, which he shot in two days with a budget of $7,500. He also managed to cast well-known actors such as Jeri Ryan, who played Sonya Blade, and Michael Jai White, who played Jackson Briggs. Both actors are fans of the Mortal Kombat games and agreed to participate in the project for free. Ian Anthony Dale, who played Scorpion, and Richard Dorton, who played Reptile, also did their own stunts and fight choreography.
 
The film's visual effects and makeup were also impressive, considering the film's low budget and short production time. The film featured realistic and gruesome depictions of the characters' abilities and fatalities, such as Scorpion's spear, Reptile's acid spit, Baraka's blades and Sub-Zero's ice blast. The film also used practical effects and prosthetics to create the characters' appearances, such as Reptile's lizard-like skin, Baraka's teeth and Sub-Zero's scarred eye.
 
Mortal Kombat: Rebirth is a testament to the power of fan creativity and dedication. The film not only revived the interest in the Mortal Kombat franchise, but also inspired other fan-made projects based on video games, such as Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist (2014) and Fallout: Nuka Break (2011). The film also proved that a faithful and successful adaptation of a video game is possible, as long as it respects the source material and its fans.
