The game has received mostly positive feedback from the community, who praise its gameplay diversity, customization options, and frequent updates. Some of the common compliments include:

> "This game is amazing! You can do anything you want, from historical battles to sci-fi wars. The editor is very easy to use and there are tons of workshop items to download. The developer is also very active and listens to the community. Highly recommended!"

> "Ancient Warfare 3 is one of the best sandbox games I have ever played. It has so much content and variety, and it is constantly updated with new features and improvements. The game is also very moddable and has a great community. If you like strategy games, you should definitely give this a try."

> "This game is a gem. It is so fun and addictive, and you can create any scenario you can imagine. The game modes are very diverse and challenging, and the AI is smart and realistic. The graphics are also very nice and the performance is smooth. This game deserves more attention and support."

Of course, the game is not perfect and it still has some issues and bugs that need to be fixed. Some of the common criticisms include:

> "The game is good, but it needs more optimization and polish. Sometimes it lags or crashes when there are too many units or explosions on the screen. The UI is also a bit clunky and hard to navigate. I hope the developer will fix these problems soon."

> "The game is fun, but it lacks some features that would make it better. For example, there is no multiplayer mode, which would be awesome for this kind of game. There is also no tutorial or manual, which makes it hard for new players to learn the basics. I hope the developer will add these features in the future."

> "The game is okay, but it gets boring after a while. There is not much depth or progression in the game, and the scenarios are mostly repetitive and random. There is also not much balance or realism in the game, and some units or weapons are too overpowered or underpowered. I hope the developer will improve these aspects in the future."

Overall, Ancient Warfare 3 is a game that has a lot of potential and appeal for strategy fans. It is a game that lets you create your own fun and enjoy endless possibilities. However, it is also a game that needs more work and polish to reach its full potential. If you are interested in this game, you can try it out for free or buy it on Steam for a reasonable price.
